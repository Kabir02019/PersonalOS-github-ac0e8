# Kabir OS - Multithreading Framework

## Overview

The Multithreading Framework is a comprehensive component of **Kabir OS**, developed by **Kabir Khanna**. This implementation demonstrates advanced multithreading concepts in C, providing a robust foundation for concurrent programming and parallel execution.

## Features

- **Thread Creation**: Advanced creation and management of multiple threads
- **Synchronization**: Robust mechanisms to avoid race conditions
- **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive thread safety implementations
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced techniques for thread management
- **Matrix Operations**: Parallel matrix computation demonstrations

## Building and Running

```bash
cd upload
make

# Run matrix operations
./matrix

# Run vector operations
./vector
```

## Architecture

This component implements core OS concurrency concepts including:
- Thread creation and lifecycle management
- Mutex and semaphore implementations
- Race condition prevention
- Parallel algorithm optimization

## Advanced Features

- **Parallel Matrix Operations**: Demonstrates concurrent matrix computations
- **Vector Processing**: Parallel vector operations for performance
- **Thread Synchronization**: Advanced synchronization primitives
- **Memory Management**: Thread-safe memory allocation

## Performance Benefits

- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple threads running simultaneously
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient sharing of system resources
- **Scalability**: Performance scales with available CPU cores
- **Responsiveness**: Improved system responsiveness through concurrency
