# Kabir OS - Process Scheduler

## Overview

The Process Scheduler is a sophisticated CPU scheduler component of **Kabir OS**, developed by **Kabir Khanna**. This implementation demonstrates advanced CPU time-sharing by managing multiple processes across a limited number of CPU cores using priority-based scheduling policies.

## Features

- **Priority-based Scheduling**: Processes can be assigned priority levels from 1 to 4
- **Quantum-based Execution**: Each process receives a set quantum of execution time
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive output demonstrating scheduling efficiency
- **Advanced Heuristics**: Sophisticated algorithms for process ordering

## Building and Running

```bash
make
./combined
```

## Architecture

This component implements core OS process management concepts including:
- CPU scheduling algorithms
- Process state management
- Context switching simulation
- Priority queue implementation
